These two videos contain a good intro to Flexbox.
Worth running through whenever you need a Flexbox refresher.

-   [Lesson 1](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/modern-css-layouts/how-to-get-started-with-flexbox)
-   [Lesson 2](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/modern-css-layouts/flexbox-container-children)

I'll include some code snippets here when I get around to it.

## Align items inside container

```html
<style>
    h1 {
        text-transform: uppercase;
        font-size: 3em;
        font-weight: 100;
        width: 200px;
    }
    .parent {
        display: flex;
        border: 1px solid blue;
        flex-direction: column;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        width: 800px;
        height: 800px;
    }

    .el {
        width: 200px;
        border: 1px solid red;
        text-align: center;
    }
</style>

<main>
    <div class="parent">
        <h1>Svelte Min</h1>
        <p>Here is some text</p>
        <div class="el">One</div>
        <div class="el">Two</div>
    </div>
</main>
```

-   main-axis: The main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. The direction is based on the flex-direction property.
-   Layout is set using (for example) `justify-content: center;`.
-   cross axis: The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main axis direction.
-   Layout on this axis is set using (for example) `align-items: center;`.

When we set `flex-direction: column` we are setting the main axis to be vertical.
Then, if we want to align items along the _horizontal_ axis, we need to use align-items.
