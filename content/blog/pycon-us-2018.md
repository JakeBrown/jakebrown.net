This was a pretty cool conference, right on the lake. Topics-wise, Machine Learning was big this year, it seems to be more and more popular every year. 

Overall, a great two weeks in Cleveland. I found a good CrossFit gym nearby so I could get in my lifts during the conference, and afterward caught the bus to NYC.
