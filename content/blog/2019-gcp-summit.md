- Introduction to Google Cloud Code released earlier this year at Google Cloud Next. Looks like an awesome way of getting the inner development loop up and running much faster
- Lots of talk of "shifting left" (i.e. shifting the things that normally happen later in the development cycle to earlier on). 
- Luke Million seeing us out with a DJ set was pretty cool.
