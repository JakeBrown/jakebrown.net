We're using Kubernetes on GCP for our entire platform these days, so I really wanted to get along to a conference and immerse myself in it.

---

 It was good, but (and I should have expected it in hindsight) far more enterprise focused than something like PyCon. 

Still, there was a good track for in-the-weeds development and I learnt a lot about CLI tools for working with Kubernetes. 

The conference has now finished and I've travelled to Moscow to visit SkyOptix contact lens lab. We're looking at partnering with them to manufacture and distribute our lenses in Russia and parts of Europe.
