It's often necessary to generate a SSH key. Here is how to do it from the terminal.

---

Just run:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C “your_email@example.com”
```

On a Mac, this will store the newly generated public and private keys in `~/.ssh`.

You can copy the public key to the clipboard using:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub|pbcopy
```
