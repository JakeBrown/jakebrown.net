D1 is Cloudflare's main relational database offering. But a year after [GA](https://blog.cloudflare.com/making-full-stack-easier-d1-ga-hyperdrive-queues/)  and it still does not have replication. They are promising it...

> D1's read replication will automatically deploy read replicas as needed to get data closer to your users: and without you having to spin up, manage scaling, or run into consistency (replication lag) issues. [2024-04-01](https://blog.cloudflare.com/making-full-stack-easier-d1-ga-hyperdrive-queues/)


> **Automatic read replication**: our new storage subsystem is built with replication in mind, and we're working on ensuring our replication layer is both fast & reliable before we roll it out to developers...**when we enable global read replication, you won't have to pay extra for it, nor will replication multiply your storage consumption**...We think built-in, automatic replication is important... [2023-05-19](https://blog.cloudflare.com/d1-turning-it-up-to-11/)

Unfortunately these promises have been misinterpreted in some cases. From the Prisma docs:

> Cloudflare's principles of geographic distribution and bringing compute and data closer to application users, **D1 supports automatic read-replication**. It dynamically manages the number of database instances and locations of read-only replicas based on how many queries a database is getting, and from where.
> For write-operations, queries travel to a single primary instance in order to propagate the changes to all read-replicas and ensure data consistency. - [Prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/overview/databases/cloudflare-d1)


I love the Syntax podcast, but in [today's episode](https://syntax.fm/879?t=0:34:24) it sounds like they have misread this too.

With Cloudflare's [developer week](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/developer-week/) next week (hopefully, the 2024 schedule is still up), here's hoping it is finally released.

**Update 10th April 2025** - it is [finally here](https://blog.cloudflare.com/d1-read-replication-beta/) and it is really, really cool.
