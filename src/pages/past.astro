      <p>
        I've been developing software professionally for 15+ years. Here is how
        I've spent the bulk of my time.
      </p>
      <h2>Academic Research</h2>
      <p>
        In 2012 I completed my studies in{" "}
        <a href="https://calendar.adelaide.edu.au/aprcw/2024/hschp_hschp">
          High Performance Computational Physics
        </a>
        ; basically a cross between Mathematical Physics and Computer Science.
        In my research project I worked on optimising large scale inversion
        problems, breaking down masivelly parallel FORTRAN code to run in
        parallel on Hadoop on AWS.
      </p>
      <p>
        While moving into private industry after my four year honours degree, I
        continued to work on Machine Learning research projects, and guest
        lectured to postgrad students on the topic of Software Architecture.
      </p>
      <h2 class="grunge-heavy">
        EyeSpace<sup>&reg;</sup>
      </h2>
      <p>
        In 2012 I co-founded medical device manufacturing company EyeSpace,
        creating software to design and manufacture contact lenses with
        state-of-the-art numerical simulation and manufacturing techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Managing Director and then Chief Technology Officer, I grew the
        company and led our team of developers building secure and maintainable
        software to facilitate the work of our manufacturers and doctors around
        the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can read more about the product at{" "}
        <a href="https://www.eye.space">www.eye.space</a>. Here are some of the
        technologies we used:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Numerical computing and machine control in Python</li>
        <li>
          Large desktop application built in Java, developed and maintained for
          14+ years
        </li>
        <li>
          Web applications built in Python/Flask and eventually ported to
          SvelteKit
        </li>
        <li>Microservices in Golang, Python, TypeScript</li>
        <li>Container orchestration on GCP with Kubernetes</li>
        <li>Serverless workflows for data processing on AWS</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I also worked with the author of{" "}
        <a href="https://www.elsevierhealth.com.au/contact-lenses-9780702071683.html?srsltid=AfmBOoqSlMUTHCViD8QrIvh36w3QuPxnjfErtbFIoXdOd7TVPJTPbuJR">
          <i>Contact Lenses, 6th Edition</i>
        </a>{" "}
        to develop an educational web app to accompany the textbook release.

      <h2>AI, Machine Learning, and Evolutionary Computing</h2>
      <p>
        The large and interesting data-sets we were working with at EyeSpace
        <sup>&reg;</sup> led me to explore modern computing techniques for both
        exploratory data analysis and inferential modelling. Internally and with
        external collaborators at the University of Adelaide.

        From analysing corneal data to extrapolate corneal height, through to
        LLM based analysis of clinical notes.
