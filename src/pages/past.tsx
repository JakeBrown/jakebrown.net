      <h2>Academic Research</h2>
      <p>
        In 2012 I completed my studies in{" "}
        <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/degree-finder/hschp_hschp.html">
          High Performance Computational Physics
        </a>
        ; basically a cross between Mathematical Physics and
        Computer Science. In my research project I worked on optimising large scale inversion problems, breaking down masivelly parallel FORTRAN code to run in parallel on Hadoop on AWS.
      </p>
      <p>While moving into private industry after my four year honours degree, I continued to work on Machine Learning research projects, and guest lectured to postgrad students on the topic of Software Architecture.</p>

      <h2>EyeSpace<sup>&reg;</sup></h2>
      <p>
        In 2012 I co-founded medical device manufacturing company EyeSpace
        <sup>&reg;</sup>, creating software to design and manufacture contact lenses
        with state-of-the-art numerical simulation and manufacturing
        techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Managing Director and then Chief Technology Officer, I grew the company and led our team of developers building secure and maintainable software to
        facilitate the work of our manufacturers and doctors around the world.
